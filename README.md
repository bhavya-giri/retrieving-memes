Using Semantic Search to retrieve memes

[Try it out!](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bhavyagiri/retrieving-memes)

### Data

The [Orginal Dataset](https://github.com/eujhwang/meme-cap) is small dataset with 6k memes which are annotated by [OpenFlamingo-9B](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_flamingo) and [MiniGPT4](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4) models for their zero-shot and few-shot experiments. 

Final Dataset and Embeddings are also available on [ðŸ¤— HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bhavyagiri/semantic-memes)
